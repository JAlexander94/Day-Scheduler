# Day-Scheduler

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The aim of the project was to make a day scheduler that you could add events to which would stay in the local storage so you could see them until they cleared for the following day

The project specifically wanted the user to be able to select

- Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persist events between refreshes of a page
- Clear the page and storage at the end of each day so the events arent for the wrong day
